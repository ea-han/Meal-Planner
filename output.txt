pastina with milk and eggs
Index: 154320


this is so good, great comfort food. this is something that one would make for a small child but its so good adults love it too. as it is, its great but you can also add some prosciutto, pancetta, etc (cook until browned in a pan with a little olive oil). also try adding veggies like peas, spinach, escarole, ect. this is from simply tuscan by pino luongo. (cooking time is just a guess since i always forget to time myself)
